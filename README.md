# AI Cloudflare Worker Chat App

This is a simple AI-powered chat application built with Node.js and Express. It uses Cloudflare's AI API to generate responses and provides a user-friendly chat interface styled like ChatGPT. Users can interact with the AI by sending queries, and the app returns responses in real-time.

## Features

- **AI-Powered Responses**: The app integrates with Cloudflare's AI API to generate AI responses to user queries.
- **Express Server**: Built on Express, making it lightweight and easy to extend.
- **Dynamic Chat Interface**: A ChatGPT-style chat interface for interactive conversations with the AI.
- **Environment Configuration**: Uses environment variables to keep sensitive information secure.

## Setup

### Prerequisites

- **Node.js**: Ensure Node.js is installed. You can download it [here](https://nodejs.org/).
- **npm**: Node Package Manager comes with Node.js.
- **Cloudflare Account**: Cloudflare API token and account ID to connect to their AI service.

### Installation

1. **Clone the Repository**:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/rajeshkumaryadavdotcom/ai-cloudflare-worker.git
   cd ai-cloudflare-worker
   ```

2. **Install Dependencies**:

   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

3. **Environment Variables**:

   Create a `.env` file in the root directory and add your Cloudflare credentials:

   ```plaintext
   CLOUDFLARE_API_TOKEN=your_cloudflare_api_token
   CLOUDFLARE_ACCOUNT_ID=your_cloudflare_account_id
   APP_URL=your_app_url.vercel.app
   ```

4. **Run the Application**:

   Start the server using `nodemon` (for development) or `node`:

   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```

   The app will be available at `http://localhost:3000`.

### Directory Structure

├── index.html
└── vercel.json       # Optional for rewrites
├── package.json      # Project dependencies and scripts
└── README.md         # Project documentation
```

## Usage

1. **Start the Server**: Run `npm run dev` to start the server.
2. **Open the Interface**: Visit `http://localhost:3000` in a browser to access the chat interface.
3. **Chat with the AI**: Type your queries in the chatbox, and the AI will respond in real-time.

### API Endpoints

- `GET /ai?search=<query>`: Accepts a query parameter and returns an AI-generated response. Example:
  
  ```bash
  http://localhost:3000/ai?search=What is the capital of France?
  ```
## Bonus
I have added front-end index.html file with chat interface.
